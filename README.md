# HostMobile - Http Server

With this app you can set up a dynamic HTTP server built with KTOR on your phone. You can upload any web files you want to this server and access it from any browser.

You can also enable the Auth feature on this server to allow users to pass 4-digit authentication before connecting to your server and viewing web files. If the auth feature is enabled, users will also have to verify the JWT token on every request, thus increasing security even more.

In addition to the Custom Server, which the user can dynamically change in the application, a Default Server is also opened at the same time. In this Default Server, you can send web files to the mobile application, use Android's SharedPreference feature via API and many more features. New features are planned for this Default Server very soon.

Log screen is available for both Default Server and Custom Server. After you open the log screen, all requests to these 2 servers and all operations performed on the server are shown on the log screen.

You can install our application for this and many more features to be added soon!
